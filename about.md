Howdy! I'm Jim Sykora. Although my website is branded around one of my favorite bits of Microsoft Active Directory (not SDProp), I'm a whole person who has interests, hobbies, and passions beyond my work and technology.  No worries, I'll probably try to tag stuff appropriately so if you only came here for [AD](/tags/activedirectory/index.html) or [Infosec](/tags/infosec/index.html) stuff, that out to be easy enough to find.

If you're looking for my CV or work experience, my LinkedIn is over here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimsykora

My most used social media platform is currently BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/jimsycurity.adminsdholder.com and you can also find me on [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@JimSycurity%7B:rel=%22me%22%7D) and [twitter - RIP](https://twitter.com/JimSycurity).

I have a Github.  I've made small contributions to a couple of open source projects, but I mostly use it to store things that are interesting to me.

I'm from Minnesota, born and raised.  It's hotdish, not a casserole.  I currently live in rural Minnesota and really haven't lived outside of MN much.  I've been very online since the mid 90's and I love to listen to and engage with folks from around the world and with different lived expereinces than me.  Now that I'm married to a wonderful wife and we budget for travel, I get to meet some of those folks and experience new things for myself.

I've pretty much known I was going to be in IT or InfoSec since I was in elementaray school when I got my first taste of Applesoft BASIC and MECC's Oregon Trail.  I've strayed from that path multiple times, but I've been at IT now in earnest for 25+ years, with my most recent focus being on defensive security, specifically protecting Active Directory.
